  - Kubernetes v1.14

Supported IBM storage systems:
  - IBM FlashSystem 9100
  - IBM Spectrum Virtualize
  - IBM Storwize

## Prerequisites for driver installation

### Preparing worker nodes
Perform these steps for each worker node in Kubernetes cluster:

#### 1. Install Linux packages to ensure Fibre Channel and iSCSI connectivity
Skip this step if the packages are already installed.

RHEL 7.x:
```sh
yum -y install iscsi-initiator-utils   # Only if iSCSI connectivity is required
yum -y install xfsprogs                # Only if XFS file system is required
```

#### 2. Configure Linux multipath devices on the host 
Create and set the relevant storage system parameters in the `/etc/multipath.conf` file. 
You can also use the default `multipath.conf` file, located in the `/usr/share/doc/device-mapper-multipath-*` directory.
Verify that the `systemctl status multipathd` output indicates that the multipath status is active and error-free.

RHEL 7.x:
```sh
yum install device-mapper-multipath
modprobe dm-multipath
systemctl enable multipathd
systemctl start multipathd
systemctl status multipathd
multipath -ll
```

**Important:** When configuring Linux multipath devices, verify that the `find_multipaths` parameter in the `multipath.conf` file is disabled. In RHEL 7.x, remove the`find_multipaths yes` string from the `multipath.conf` file.

#### 3. Configure storage system connectivity
3.1. Define the hostname of each Kubernetes node on the relevant storage systems with the valid WWPN (for Fibre Channel) or IQN (for iSCSI) of the node. 

3.2. For Fibre Channel, configure the relevant zoning from the storage to the host.

3.3. For iSCSI, perform the following steps:

3.3.1. Make sure that the login to the iSCSI targets is permanent and remains available after a reboot of the worker node. To do this, verify that the node.startup in the /etc/iscsi/iscsid.conf file is set to automatic. If not, set it as required and then restart the iscsid service `$> service iscsid restart`.

3.3.2. Discover and log into at least two iSCSI targets on the relevant storage systems. (NOTE: Without at least two ports, a multipath device will not be created.)

```sh
$> iscsiadm -m discoverydb -t st -p ${STORAGE-SYSTEM-iSCSI-PORT-IP1}:3260 --discover
$> iscsiadm -m node -p ${STORAGE-SYSTEM-iSCSI-PORT-IP1} --login

$> iscsiadm -m discoverydb -t st -p ${STORAGE-SYSTEM-iSCSI-PORT-IP2}:3260 --discover
$> iscsiadm -m node -p ${STORAGE-SYSTEM-iSCSI-PORT-IP2} --login
```

3.3.3. Verify that the login was successful and display all targets that you logged into. The portal value must be the iSCSI target IP address.

```sh
$> iscsiadm -m session --rescan
Rescanning session [sid: 1, target: {storage system IQN},
portal: {STORAGE-SYSTEM-iSCSI-PORT-IP1},{port number}
portal: {STORAGE-SYSTEM-iSCSI-PORT-IP2},{port number}
```

End of worker node setup.

## Installing the driver
This section describes how to install the CSI driver.

From version 1.0.0, the deployment method of the driver is done via `Operator for IBM Block CSI Driver` -> https://github.com/ibm/ibm-block-csi-operator.


## Configuring k8s secret and storage class
In order to use the driver, create the relevant storage classes and secrets, as needed.

This section describes how to:
 1. Create a storage system secret - to define the storage system credentials (user and password) and its address.
 2. Configure the k8s storage class - to define the storage system pool name, secret reference, SpaceEfficiency (thin, compressed, or deduplicated) and fstype (xfs\ext4).

#### 1. Create an array secret 
Create a secret file as follows `array-secret.yaml` and update the relevant credentials:

```
kind: Secret
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: <VALUE-1>
  namespace: kube-system
type: Opaque
stringData:
  management_address: <VALUE-2,VALUE-3> # Array managment addresses
  username: <VALUE-4>                   # Array username  
data:
  password: <VALUE-5 base64>            # Array password
```

Apply the secret:

```
$> kubectl apply -f array-secret.yaml
```

#### 2. Create storage classes

Create a storage class yaml file `storageclass-gold.yaml` as follows, with the relevant capabilities, pool and, array secret:

```sh
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: gold
provisioner: block.csi.ibm.com
parameters:
  #SpaceEfficiency: <VALUE>    # Optional: Values applicable for Storwize are: thin, compressed, or deduplicated
  pool: <VALUE_POOL_NAME>

  csi.storage.k8s.io/provisioner-secret-name: <VALUE_ARRAY_SECRET>
  csi.storage.k8s.io/provisioner-secret-namespace: <VALUE_ARRAY_SECRET_NAMESPACE>
  csi.storage.k8s.io/controller-publish-secret-name: <VALUE_ARRAY_SECRET>
  csi.storage.k8s.io/controller-publish-secret-namespace: <VALUE_ARRAY_SECRET_NAMESPACE>

  csi.storage.k8s.io/fstype: xfs   # Optional: Values ext4/xfs. The default is ext4.
```

Apply the storage class:

```sh
$> kubectl apply -f storageclass-gold.yaml
storageclass.storage.k8s.io/gold created
```

## Driver usage
Create PVC demo-pvc-gold using `demo-pvc-gold.yaml`:

```sh 
$> cat demo-pvc-gold.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: pvc-demo
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
  storageClassName: gold

$> kubectl apply -f demo-pvc-gold.yaml
persistentvolumeclaim/demo-pvc created
```


Create StatefulSet application `demo-statefulset` that uses the demo-pvc.

```sh
$> cat demo-statefulset-with-demo-pvc.yml
kind: StatefulSet
apiVersion: apps/v1
metadata:
  name: demo-statefulset
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: demo-statefulset
  serviceName: demo-statefulset
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: demo-statefulset
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: container1
        image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi:latest
        command: [ "/bin/sh", "-c", "--" ]
        args: [ "while true; do sleep 30; done;" ]
        volumeMounts:
          - name: pvc-demo
            mountPath: "/data"
      volumes:
      - name: pvc-demo
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: pvc-demo

      #nodeSelector:
      #  kubernetes.io/hostname: NODESELECTOR


$> kubectl create -f demo-statefulset-with-demo-pvc.yml
statefulset/demo-statefulset created

$> kubectl get pod demo-statefulset-0
NAME                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
demo-statefulset-0   1/1     Running   0          43s

###### Review the mountpoint inside the pod:
$> kubectl exec demo-statefulset-0 -- bash -c "df -h /data"
Filesystem          Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/mapper/mpathz 1014M   33M  982M   4% /data
```


Delete StatefulSet and PVC

```sh
$> kubectl delete statefulset/demo-statefulset
statefulset/demo-statefulset deleted

$> kubectl get statefulset/demo-statefulset
No resources found.

$> kubectl delete pvc/demo-pvc
persistentvolumeclaim/demo-pvc deleted

$> kubectl get pv,pvc
No resources found.
```
