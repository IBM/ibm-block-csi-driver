# Installing the host definer with GitHub

The host definer for IBMÂ® block storage CSI driver can be installed directly with GitHub.

Use the following steps to install the HostDefiner custom resource, with [GitHub](https://github.com/IBM/ibm-block-csi-operator).

**Note:** Only hosts added after the host definer installation are dynamically defined within the CSI driver.

1. Download the custom resource manifest from [GitHub](https://github.com/IBM/ibm-block-csi-operator).

        curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/ibm-block-csi-operator/v1.10.0/config/samples/csi_v1_hostdefiner.yaml > csi_v1_hostdefiner.yaml

2. Install the `csi_v1_hostdefiner.yaml`.

        kubectl apply -f csi_v1_hostdefiner.yaml

After the host definer is installed, it searches for nodes that have not yet been defined on storage, and defines them.
