# Upgrading

Use this information to upgrade the IBM速 block storage CSI driver and host definer.

## IBM速 block storage CSI driver upgrade

The Red Hat OpenShift web console and OperatorHub.io both automatically upgrade the CSI (Container Storage Interface) driver when a new version is released.
- To manually upgrade the IBM block storage CSI driver with the Red Hat OpenShift web console, see [Manual upgrade with OpenShift](upgrade_manual_openshift.md).
- To manually upgrade the IBM block storage CSI driver from a previous version with GitHub, perform step 1 of the [installation procedure](install_driver_github.md) for the latest version.
- With OpenShift web console, the **Approval Strategy** must be set to **Automatic**.

To check if your operator is running at the latest release level, from the OpenShift web console, browse to **Operators** > **Installed Operators**. Check the status of the IBM block storage CSI driver operator. Ensure that the **Upgrade Status** is _Up to date_. For more information about automatic upgrades, see https://olm.operatorframework.io/docs/concepts/crds/subscription/.{: tip}

## IBM速 block storage CSI host definer upgrade

If the host definer was installed with GitHub, the host definer must be updated manually.{: important}

To enable the optional host definer feature when upgrading from IBM速 block storage CSI driver 1.9.0 or earlier, the host definer must be manually installed.{: attention}

- If the host definer was installed from the Red Hat OpenShift web console or OperatorHub.io, the host definer automatically updates along with the driver version.
- For manual upgrade of the host definer with GitHub and OperatorHub.io, simply install the latest version, as described in [Installing the host definer](install_hostdefiner.md).
- For manual upgrade with the Red Hat OpenShift webconsole, see [Manual upgrade with OpenShift](upgrade_manual_openshift.md).
