# Installing the host definer

Install the HostDefiner custom resource to enable dynamic host definitions of the CSI driver nodes.

For information on configuring the HostDefiner custom resource, see [Configuring the host definer](../configuration/configuring_hostdefiner).

For more information on using dynamic host connectivity definition, see [Using dynamic host definition](../using/using_hostdefinition.md).

The host definer can be downloaded and installed from the OpenShift web console and OperatorHub.io, as part of the operator and driver installation process. For more information, see [Installing the driver with the OpenShift web console](install_driver_openshift_web.md) and [Installing the driver with OperatorHub.io](install_driver_operatorhub.md).

The host definer can also be installed directly with GitHub (see [Installing the host definer with GitHub](install_hostdefiner_github.md)).

**Note:** The host definer can be installed at any time.
