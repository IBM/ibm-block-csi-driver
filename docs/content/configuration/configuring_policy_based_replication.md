# Configuring for policy-based replication

Use this information for specific configuring information when using policy-based replication with the IBMÂ® block storage CSI driver.

Policy-based replication uses volume groups to automatically deploy and manage replication. Be sure to use dynamic volume groups when configuring the CSI driver for policy-based replication.

See the following sections for more information:
