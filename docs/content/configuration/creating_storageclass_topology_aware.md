# Creating a StorageClass with topology awareness

When using the CSI Topology feature, different parameters must be taken into account when creating a storage class YAML file with specific `by_management_id` requirements. Use this information to help define a StorageClass that is topology aware.

**Note:** For information and parameter definitions that are not related to topology awareness, be sure to see the information provided in [Creating a StorageClass](creating_volumestorageclass.md), in addition to the current section.

The StorageClass file must be defined to contain topology information, based off of the labels that were already defined on the nodes in the cluster (see [Compatibility and requirements](../installation/install_compatibility_requirements.md)). This determines the storage pools that are then served as candidates for PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) requests made, as well as the subset of nodes that can make use of the volumes provisioned by the CSI driver.

With topology awareness, the StorageClass must have the `volumeBindingMode` set to `WaitForFirstConsumer` (as defined in the `.yaml` example below). This defines that any PVCs that are requested with this specific StorageClass, will wait to be configured until the CSI driver can see the worker node topology.

The `by_management_id` parameter is optional and values such as the `pool`, `SpaceEfficiency`, and `volume_name_prefix` may all be specified.

The various `by_management_id` parameters are chosen within the following hierarchical order:
1. From within the `by_management_id` parameter, per system (if specified).
2. Outside of the parameter, as a cross-system default (if not specified within the `by_management_id` parameter for the relevant `management-id`).

        kind: StorageClass
        apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
        metadata:
          name: demo-storageclass-config-secret
        provisioner: block.csi.ibm.com
        volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
        parameters:
          # non-csi.storage.k8s.io parameters may be specified in by_management_id per system and/or outside by_management_id as the cross-system default.

          by_management_id: '{"demo-management-id-1":{"pool":"demo-pool-1","SpaceEfficiency":"dedup_compressed","volume_name_prefix":"demo-prefix-1"},
                              "demo-management-id-2":{"pool":"demo-pool-2","volume_name_prefix":"demo-prefix-2", "io_group": "demo-iogrp"}}'  # Optional.
          pool: demo-pool
          SpaceEfficiency: thin            # Optional.
          volume_name_prefix: demo-prefix  # Optional.

          csi.storage.k8s.io/fstype: xfs   # Optional. Values ext4/xfs. The default is ext4.
          csi.storage.k8s.io/secret-name: demo-config-secret
          csi.storage.k8s.io/secret-namespace: default
        allowVolumeExpansion: true

Apply the storage class.

  ```
  kubectl apply -f <filename>.yaml
  ```
The `storageclass.storage.k8s.io/<storageclass-name> created` message is emitted.
