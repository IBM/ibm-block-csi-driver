# Importing an existing volume group

Use this information to import volume groups that were created externally from the IBMÂ® block storage CSI driver, by using a VolumeGroupContent YAML file.

**Attention:** Read these important notices before importing a volume group. If these conditions are not met existing volumes within the volume group are deleted. 
  1. Before you begin importing existing volume groups from the storage system, be sure to import any existing volumes that belong to the volume groups that will be imported (see [Importing an existing volume](importing_existing_volume.md)). When importing volumes, add the relevant labels to ensure that the volume is pointing to the volume group (see [Creating a PVC within a volume group with the dynamic volume group feature](creating_pvc.md#creating-a-pvc-within-a-volume-group-with-the-dynamic-volume-group-feature)).

  2. Volume groups can only be managed by **either** the associated VolumeGroup **or** the associated StorageClass (with the `volume_group` parameter). If a volume group is imported and a StorageClass is already associated with it, then each volume of this StorageClass can be automatically deleted after the import.

Before starting to import an existing volume group, find the `volumeGroupHandle` in the existing volume group in order to include the information in the VolumeGroupContent YAML file. 

The `volumeGroupHandle` is formatted as `SVC:id;name`.

Through the Spectrum Virtualize command-line, find both the `id` and `name` attributes, by using the `lsvolumegroup` command.

For more information, see **Command-line interface** > **Volume commands** > **lsvolumegroup** within your specific product documentation on [IBM Documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/).

**Note:** The volume group name can also be found through the management GUI. Go to **Volumes** > **Volume Groups** from the side bar.
  
Use this procedure to help build a VolumeGroupContent YAML file for your volume groups.

1. Create a VolumeGroupContent YAML file.

    **Important:** Be sure to include the `volumeGroupHandle` parameter or errors may occur.

    Update the volumeGroupHandle according to the volume group information found previously.
   
    ```
    apiVersion: csi.ibm.com/v1
    kind: VolumeGroupContent
    metadata:
      name: demo-volumegroupcontent
    spec:
      source:
        driver: block.csi.ibm.com
        volumeGroupHandle: SVC:id;name
    ```

3. Create a VolumeGroup YAML file.

    **Note:**

    - Be sure to include the `volumeGroupClassName`.
    - For more information about creating a VolumeGroup YAML file, see [Creating a VolumeGroup](creating_volumegroup.md).
    
    ```
    apiVersion: csi.ibm.com/v1
    kind: VolumeGroup
    metadata:
      name: demo-volumegroup-from-content
    spec:
      volumeGroupClassName: demo-volumegroupclass
      source:
        volumeGroupContentName: demo-volumegroupcontent
        selector: 
          matchLabels:
            demo-volumegroup-key: demo-volumegroup-value
    ```
