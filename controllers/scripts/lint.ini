[MESSAGES CONTROL]
# Disable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s). You
# can either give multiple identifier separated by comma (,) or put this option
# multiple time (only on the command line, not in the configuration file where
# it should appear only once).
# relevant categories: E - Error, W - Warning, R - Refactor, C - Convention
disable=
 # easy:
 raise-missing-from, # W - happened only on Jenkins, add "from" after some of the "raise"
 redefined-builtin, redefined-outer-name, # W, W - colliding names: e.g. type, e.g. config
 consider-using-from-import, # R - redundant "as" after "import"
 protected-access, # W - convert private-methods UTs to public. some might require to add mocks
 no-member, # E - fix easy ones (_AssertRaisesContext,Base*Exception,Abstract*Test), disable the rest in code (protobuf)
 consider-using-f-string, # C - use f-string instead of ".format" (or fix logging-format-interpolation)

 # medium:
 no-value-for-parameter, # E - some tests should avoid using mock.patch as a decorator. e.g. with "with" instead
 abstract-method, # W - happened only on Jenkins, but shouldn't: https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/179
 duplicate-code, # R - usually fixable with a wrapper function/inheritance
  # defaults can be overridden in this file, to "freeze" exiting abuse from growing
  too-many-lines, # C - default max per file: 1000
  too-many-public-methods, too-few-public-methods, # R - default per class: max 20, min 2
  too-many-statements, too-many-return-statements, # R - default max per function: 50, 6
  too-many-arguments, too-many-instance-attributes, too-many-locals, # R - default max: 5, 7, 15

 # hard:
 broad-except, # W - "except Exception" is too general
 logging-format-interpolation, # W - str.format in logger calls is inefficient, use lazy evaluation instead (e.g. %)

 # not in plan to enable:
 missing-module-docstring, missing-class-docstring, missing-function-docstring, # C - not a must if code is clean
 fixme, # W - as long as we allow adding TODOs - can be remained disabled
 invalid-overridden-method, # W - our @classproperty definition hack
 unrecognized-option, # E - common custom regex variables in this file
