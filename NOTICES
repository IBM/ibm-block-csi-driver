@@@@@@@@@@@@
===========================================================================
THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS APPLY to Red Hat Universal
Base Image Version 7 software:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT

RED HAT UNIVERSAL BASE IMAGE

PLEASE READ THIS END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT CAREFULLY BEFORE USING
SOFTWARE FROM RED HAT. BY USING RED HAT SOFTWARE, YOU SIGNIFY YOUR
ASSENT TO AND ACCEPTANCE OF THIS END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT AND
ACKNOWLEDGE YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THE TERMS. AN INDIVIDUAL ACTING
ON BEHALF OF AN ENTITY REPRESENTS THAT HE OR SHE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO
ENTER INTO THIS END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF THAT ENTITY. IF
YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, THEN YOU MUST NOT USE THE
RED HAT SOFTWARE. THIS END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY
RIGHTS TO RED HAT SERVICES SUCH AS SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE, UPGRADES OR
SUPPORT. PLEASE REVIEW YOUR SERVICE OR SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT(S) THAT
YOU MAY HAVE WITH RED HAT OR OTHER AUTHORIZED RED HAT SERVICE PROVIDERS
REGARDING SERVICES AND ASSOCIATED PAYMENTS.

This end user license agreement (“EULA”) governs the use of Red Hat
Universal Base Image and associated software supporting such
container(s) and any related updates, source code, including the
appearance, structure and organization (the “Programs”), regardless
of the delivery mechanism. If a Red Hat Universal Base Image is included
in another Red Hat product, the EULA terms of such other Red Hat product
will apply and supersede this EULA. If a Red Hat Universal Base Image is
included in a third party work, the terms of this EULA will continue to
govern the Red Hat Universal Base Image.

1. License Grant. Subject to the terms of this EULA, Red Hat, Inc.
(“Red Hat”) grants to you a perpetual, worldwide license to the
Programs (each of which may include multiple software components). With
the exception of the Red Hat trademark identified in Section 2 below,
each software component is governed by a license that permits you to
run, copy, modify, and redistribute (subject to certain obligations in
some cases) the software components. This EULA pertains solely to the
Programs and does not limit your rights under, or grant you rights that
supersede, the license terms applicable to any particular component. The
license terms applicable to each software component are provided in the
source code of that component.

2. Intellectual Property Rights. The Programs and each of their
components are owned by Red Hat and other licensors and are protected
under copyright law and other laws as applicable. Title to the Programs
and any component shall remain with Red Hat and other licensors, subject
to the applicable license, excluding any independently developed and
licensed work. The “Red Hat” trademark is a registered trademark of
Red Hat and its affiliates in the U.S. and other countries. Subject to
Red Hat’s trademark usage guidelines (set forth at
http://www.redhat.com/about/corporate/trademark/), this EULA permits you
to distribute the Programs that include the Red Hat trademark, provided
you do not make any statements on behalf of Red Hat, including but not
limited to, stating or in any way suggesting (in any public, private
and/or confidential statement (whether written or verbal)) that Red Hat
supports or endorses software built and delivered with a Red Hat
Universal Base Image(s) (such derivative works referred to as a “Red
Hat Based Container Images”); provided if a Red Hat Based Container
Image is Red Hat Certified and deployed on a Red Hat supported
configuration as set forth at https://access.redhat.com/articles/2726611
then you may state that the Red Hat Universal Base Image is supported by
Red Hat. You agree to include this unmodified EULA in all distributions
of container images sourced, built or otherwise derived from the
Programs. If you modify the Red Hat Universal Base Image(s), you must
remove any Red Hat trademark(s) prior to any subsequent distribution.
Any breach of this Section 2 is a material breach of the EULA and you
may no longer use and/or distribute the Red Hat trademark(s).
Modifications to the software may corrupt the Programs.

3. Limited Warranty. Except as specifically stated in this Section 3, a
separate agreement with Red Hat, or a license for a particular
component, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the
Programs and the components are provided and licensed “as is”
without warranty of any kind, expressed or implied, including the
implied warranties of merchantability, non-infringement or fitness for a
particular purpose. Neither Red Hat nor its affiliates warrant that the
functions contained in the Programs will meet your requirements or that
the operation of the Programs will be entirely error free, appear or
perform precisely as described in the accompanying documentation, or
comply with regulatory requirements. Red Hat warrants that the media on
which the Programs and the components are provided will be free from
defects in materials and manufacture under normal use for a period of 30
days from the date of delivery to you. This warranty extends only to the
party that purchases subscription services for the supported
configurations from Red Hat and/or its affiliates or a Red Hat
authorized distributor.

4. Limitation of Remedies and Liability. To the maximum extent permitted
by applicable law, your exclusive remedy under this EULA is to return
any defective media within 30 days of delivery along with a copy of your
payment receipt and Red Hat, at its option, will replace it or refund
the money you paid for the media. To the maximum extent permitted under
applicable law, under no circumstances will Red Hat, its affiliates, any
Red Hat authorized distributor, or the licensor of any component
provided to you under this EULA be liable to you for any incidental or
consequential damages, including lost profits or lost savings arising
out of the use or inability to use the Programs or any component, even
if Red Hat, its affiliates, an authorized distributor, and/or licensor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages. In no event shall
Red Hat's or its affiliates’ liability, an authorized distributor’s
liability or the liability of the licensor of a component provided to
you under this EULA exceed the amount that you paid to Red Hat for the
media under this EULA.

5. Export Control. As required by the laws of the United States and
other countries, you represent and warrant that you: (a) understand that
the Programs and their components may be subject to export controls
under the U.S. Commerce Department’s Export Administration Regulations
(“EAR”); (b) are not located in a prohibited destination country
under the EAR or U.S. sanctions regulations (currently Cuba, Iran, North
Korea, Sudan, Syria, and the Crimea Region of Ukraine, subject to change
as posted by the United States government); (c) will not export,
re-export, or transfer the Programs to any prohibited destination,
persons or entities on the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security Denied
Parties List or Entity List, or the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets
Control list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons, or
any similar lists maintained by other countries, without the necessary
export license(s) or authorizations(s); (d) will not use or transfer the
Programs for use in connection with any nuclear, chemical or biological
weapons, missile technology, or military end-uses where prohibited by an
applicable arms embargo, unless authorized by the relevant government
agency by regulation or specific license; (e) understand and agree that
if you are in the United States and export or transfer the Programs to
eligible end users, you will, to the extent required by EAR Section
740.17(e), submit semi-annual reports to

   "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work

   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
   as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

   meet the following conditions:

   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or

       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
       the Derivative Works; and

   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
       as modifying the License.

   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
   the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
